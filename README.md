# UnityNEAT-Pathfinding

This project uses the UnityNEAT package to simulate an ANN that figures out how to properly avoid obstacles and reach an objective after being presented with several short mazes. The fitness score is calculated based on the distance to the goal and how many times it successfully avoided a wall.
